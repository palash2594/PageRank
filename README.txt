Simple Python Search Spider, Page Ranker, and Visualizer

This is a set of programs that emulate some of the functions of a 
search engine.  They store their data in a SQLITE3 database named
'spider.sqlite'.  This file can be removed at any time to restart the
process.   

This program crawls a web site and pulls a series of pages into the
database, recording the links between pages.
